# Function Hooking:

A function hook within the kernel refers to a technique where you **modify the behavior of a kernel function** 
by **intercepting its execution**. Essentially, you “hook” into an existing function in the kernel, so that when 
thatfunction is called, **your custom code (or “hook”) is executed either before, after, or instead of 
the original function**.

Function hooks are commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as:
- Monitoring or modifying system calls.
- Adding custom behavior to existing kernel functionality.
- Debugging or tracing.
- Implementing security or performance enhancements.
