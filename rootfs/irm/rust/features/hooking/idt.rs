//! This module is responsible for hooking the IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) to redirect the
//! interrupt to a custom handler.
//!
//! The IDT is a table that is used to determine the correct response to interrupts and exceptions.
//! The IDT is an array of 256 entries, each of which is an 8-byte structure. Each entry in the IDT
//! is called a gate. The IDT is loaded into the processor using the `lidt` instruction.
